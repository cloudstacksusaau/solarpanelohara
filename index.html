     <p>
      Our Residential Solar Team works directly with you to understand your home’s electricity demand, to design, create and install the most efficient solar system possible. Our Solar Experts answer all of your questions so you know exactly what to expect with us and how solar will change your life! Our engineers will inspect your roof to make sure it qualifies for solar and our electricians inspect your electrical equipment to see if any work is required, so you know we only do things correctly. We are qualified to do any repair work needed on your home before moving forward, so that you always work with the same team throughout the entire installation process. We provide free consultations and will provide you with a solar proposal anytime you like and of course we’ll show you how much you’ll save with solar, how much your tax credits will be and how going solar can increase the value of your home. 95% of our clients go solar for $0 out-of-pocket because our lending partners provide competitive rates to finance your solar system, so you start saving money instantly. You can also qualify for the 26% tax credit if you finance your solar system, but don’t worry we’ll explain all of that when one of our solar consultants presents your solar savings proposal to you!
